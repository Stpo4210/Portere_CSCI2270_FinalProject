The Labrynth
Summary: The program is a single-player game. In which, the player is a struct to keep track of how many markers they have, how many gems have been found, and what weapon they have. Inside the labrynth, which is a class, are gems, markers, and monsters to keep the player guessing and moving around. For each turn the player encouters, the player will then have to decide which direction they want to turn, given their options, or turn around and go back to where they were. After all 3 gems have been found, a door will open in which the player will finally be able to leave the labrynth and win the game after killing the dragon. This will end the game, as well as, forcibly exiting or dying. Within the maze, the player will be able to drop struct markers, these markers are able to be written on to allow the player to give themselves explicit directions. A player can then walk over the marker and look at their instructions and figure out another path. (Note: There is a dragon once all gems are found which can be found on the starting position. Good luck fighting it).
